# Predicting-house-prices
Predicting house prices with Ames housing data 

The aim of the project was to: 
1. Identify fixed and renovateable features of the house
2. Predict house sale price using fixed features
3. Estimate potential renovation costs in order to identify properties, where renovation would increase profit from the potential house sale. 
4. Identify what features predict abnormal sale condition (trade, foreclosure, short sale)
